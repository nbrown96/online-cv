projects:
  - project: Electronics Laboratory (Physics 133) Final Project
    title: Dual Slope Analog-to-Digital Converter
    tagline: "Implemented a dual-slope ADC, improving upon a provided schematic by substantially reducing noise in the output signal and implementing a one-digit LED display."
  - project: Optics Laboratoy (Physics 134) Final Project
    title: The Polarization States of Zeeman-Split Envelopes of a Helium-Neon Laser
    tagline: "Applying a magnetic field to a Helium-Neon laser splits the laser's spectrum into two Doppler envelopes. One of these is mostly right circular polarized with some left circular polarization, and the other is mostly left circular polarized with some right circular polarization. Using optical techniques, I examined the dependence of the complex phase between the left and right circular components of each envelope on magnetic field strength."
  - project: Theoretical Mechanics (Physics 111) Final Project
    title: Chaotic Magnetic Pendulum
    tagline: "Using Mathematica, investigated the chaotic behavior of a magnetic pendulum and the system's dependence on initial position."
  - project: Computational Methods in Physics (Physics 170) Final Project
    title: Coarse Granular Mixing
    tagline: "Using Mathematica, performed two-dimensional simulations of mixing of identical particles in a spinning container."
